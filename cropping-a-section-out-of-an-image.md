# Cropping a Section out of an Image in Photoshop
1. Type `P` for the pen tool.
2. Click along the periphery of the section you’re looking to crop out. **Note**: While holding the mouse button down, you may drag the mouse to create an arc.
3. Repeat step 2 until you get to the first marker you made, forming a bounding area around the section of the image you want to crop.
4. Click **Selection...** along the top, to the right of **Path**
5. Leave **Feather Radius** at `0`, check off **Anti-aliased** and **New Selection**
6. Duplicate the layer by typing `Command + J`

**Note**: Enable “Show Transform Controls” on the top so you can see the bounding boxes of focused assets.
