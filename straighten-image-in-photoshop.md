# Straightening an Image in Photoshop

1. Choose the **Ruler Tool** (`I`), which is packaged with the **Eyedropper Tool** and **Color Sampler Tool**.
2. Find a line in the image that you’ll use as a guide to straighten the image.
3. Click the beginning of the line you’ve chosen, then drag the line across until you’re happy with the alignment.
4. Choose **Window** | **Options**.
5. Click the rectangular box marked **Straigten Layer** along the top.

**Note**: The bounding box of the image is bound (no pun intended) to exceed the dimensions of the image. How do we deal with that?
